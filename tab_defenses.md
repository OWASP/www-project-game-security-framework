## Defenses

The table below lists some of the possible defense that can be used to counter attacks against various components of a video game.

| Defenses | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Cryptographic Validation of Client | Ensure that the client will not run if it has been modified. |
| Enterprise-level DDoS Protection | Implement protection against low to mid-tier DDoS attacks against the core gaming infrastructure. |
| Basic Application Security Defenses | Code-based protections against common application security flaws, such as SQLi, XSS, CSRF, LFI/RFI, etc. |
| Authentication Lockouts | Lock out a user's account after a certain number of failed attempts. |
| Two-factor Authentication | Require use of 2FA on a given player's account. |
| Better Code | Any fixes that can be done in code that aren't covered by other defenses. Could include net code, physics engine, logic fixes, etc. 
| Server-side Validation | Ensure that validations are performed on the server and not (only) the client. |
